	<p>A web-based Settlers of Catan game for 4 to 6 non-local players.</p>
	<p>
		The game is still in active development, as such expect bugs, unintended behaviour,
		and terrible developer placeholder graphics. Features are subject to change without notice.
	</p>
	<p>
		The game does not currently support any communication between players, as such it is
		recommended that players use a 3rd party voice/text communication system such as
		<a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>, or
		<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/">Steam Chat</a>.
